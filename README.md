### About this Project

I made this 2 player game before starting Founders & Coders as a refresher exercise in DOM manipulation, using github and applied JavaScript algorithms. A very simple front end project, the most interesting part was probably deciding how to approach the 'checkForWinner' function. The algorithm I wrote compares an array of the cells containing either Xs or Os against a nested array of the 8 possible winning formations.

The design was aesthetic was minimal and fun, I think the overall effect is rather sweet.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you enjoyed reading this project or have any questions!
